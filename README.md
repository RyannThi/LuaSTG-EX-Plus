# LuaSTG EX Plus  
  
This is a fork of Xiliusha's LuaSTG EX Plus repo except they're not encoded in unspeakable chinese encodings but rather UTF-8-BOM

Also there's a folder with the prebuilt stuff and a readily compiled exe though theres no icon or metadata in it because the .rc files exploded

Also also thank you Kuanlan you're my savior for helping me do this
